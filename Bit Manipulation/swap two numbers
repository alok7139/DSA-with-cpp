/*
You are given two numbers 'a' and 'b' as input.



You must swap the values of 'a' and 'b'.



For Example:
Input: 
'a' = 8, 'b' = 5

Output:
5 8

Explanation:
Initially, the value of 'a' and 'b' is 8 and 5, respectively.

After swapping, the value of 'a' is 5, and the value of 'b' is 8.

void swapNumber(int &a, int &b) {
	// Write your code here.
	// int temp=a;
	// a=b;
	// b=temp;
	int res = a^b;
	a = res^a;
	b = res^b;
