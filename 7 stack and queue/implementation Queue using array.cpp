/*
Queue is a linear data structure that follows the idea of First In First Out. That means insertion and retrieval operations happen at opposite ends.



Implement a simple queue using arrays.



You are given 'query' queries which are either of the 2 types:



1 'e': Enqueue (add) element ‘e’ at the end of the queue.

2: Dequeue (retrieve) the element from the front of the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
